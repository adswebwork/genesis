Genesis Version 1.4 Release Information

General information
This application was built on the Linux platform utilizing PHP, CSS, JavaScript and SQLite. It uses these technologies to create a dynamic and light weight yet very powerful application. At less than 10mb, this portable project will greatly ease all of the necessary tasks in regards to site development and design. The core structure was written/compiled by Andre D. Spencer in 2008.  This includes 80% of the project. This application was developed for use in website development as a content management system, and requires no customization. It is also packaged with pre-production folders including ‘Buildout’ and ‘Comps’. 

Password Protection
This project includes a password protection script. So if you choose to upload it to your web server, your content will be protected for unauthorized use.

Dynamic file and Folder List
This function creates the ‘dashboard’ section for the Genesis&trade; application. It scans the folder that contains your project files, and lists them automatically. It also gives you the option to open each respective file and indicates what type of file it is.

Dynamic image list with search options
This section of the application is my favorite. Very often developers need to find out detailed information about a specific or even a group of images. This function does just that. It will search the ‘images’ folder of the project and return all the images and everything needed to use it. It will display the image filename, dimensions, size and even generate the code for HTML/PHP or CSS. This function also gives you the opportunity to search by file names or file extensions.

Pre-packaged standalone JavaScript applications
This dynamic arrangement of scripts gets larger with each release of Genesis&trade;. There are currently 10 scripts available. To view details of these scripts, visit the scripts folder located within the Genesis&trade; Project.

Integrated PHP info link
Very often developers need to find out exactly what version of php they have available.
That option is now 1 click away. With ‘PHP Info’ you can quickly see what capabilities are at your disposal.

Thumbnail view of images
This was the latest addition to the previous version of Genesis&trade;. This option allows for a actual size image in a tooltip format. Simply hover over of the image icon for a particular file, and you will see the image at full resolution.





SEO – SER – Analytics Automation
When you provide the required information from the order forms, you can now simply click a link ('write to file') and have your website page automatically updated with the SEO values. Please be sure to read the disclaimer in red. It is very important that you follow the standards listed in the buildout documentation. Included in this release is the Buildout project structure. Utilize this pre-made project to ensure maximum compatibility.

Keyword formatting for search engine registration
The text area currently receives the copy/paste information directly from the order form. Simply copy each column (6-1) then (12 -7) and paste it into the sitewide keywords text area. Then click the format button, and the content is automatically formatted with the appropriate structure with ',' and no carriage returns.

Project Level Links
When inside of a project folder, if you navigate to a folder within the project ('images, css…') you will now have the option to quickly get back to the previous level.

Local Color Calculator
A color calculator is now available within the scripts folder. It automatically generates the Hex, Decimal and HTML value of the chosen color.

Database Storage of Project Information
This most recent addition allows you to add/edit/delete the live & review url links for each project.
